## Isobel R. Abell, James M. McCaw, and Christopher M. Baker

This repository contains the code to generate the figures presented in Understanding the impact of disease and vaccine mechanisms on the importance of optimal vaccine allocation. 

The data was generated using code written in MATLAB version 9.10 and the code to generate figures was written in python version 3.9 using standard libraries including <code>numpy</code> and <code>matplotlib<\code>.
  
The main analysis in this paper is done using data generated in file <code>main_data_generation.m</code> . All plots, included those in the supplementary materials, are generated using functions in file ...
